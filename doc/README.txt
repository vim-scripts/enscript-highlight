EnScript highlighting support for VIM
=====================================

  This plugin adds syntax highlighting for Encase Scripts (aka enscript files).

  Actually it is a modified version of the cpp.vim module, but I'm planning
  to add autocompletion and more fixups.

  Please. Feel free to send me patches and bug reports!

                                                                      Thanks


Installation:
-------------

On w32:
 - Copy the vimfiles/ directory into your vim home.
 - Copy enscript.vim into your vim's home
 - Add this line to your vimrc: (_vimrc on w32):
   source /path/to/vim/enscript.vim

There's a sample vimrc that you can get it if you want to test my own
vim configuration :)

Have fun!
